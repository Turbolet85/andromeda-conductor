# Test Plan — Amendments

_Append-only changelog of amendments to `test-plan.md` (the body holds only current truth; history lives here + in git). Written by /andromeda-wrap-session P2._

## 2026-06-15-structured-logging-stack — self-obs stream noted as distinct from the emission journal
**Section:** §3 Test Harness Contract / Log format
**Change:** added a note that the `tracing` self-observation stream (stderr / `logs/agent-latest.jsonl`; per-line base fields incl service-identity + `run_id`, obs-plan §3) is a SEPARATE artifact from the per-run emission journal (`runs/<run_id>.jsonl`, the SLO ground truth + Run-report envelope) — the two schemas must not be conflated.
**Why:** D-tests-obs-harness fired on the chunk's new flat `service.*` self-obs fields. Validated (main) that those belong to the self-obs stream, NOT the emission-journal envelope test-plan §3 owns — so the bound §3 ↔ obs-plan §3 envelope is unchanged; the amendment is a clarifying cross-reference, not a field addition to the envelope.
