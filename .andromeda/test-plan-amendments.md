# Test Plan — Amendments

_Append-only changelog of amendments to `test-plan.md` (the body holds only current truth; history lives here + in git). Written by /andromeda-wrap-session P2._

## 2026-06-15-structured-logging-stack — self-obs stream noted as distinct from the emission journal
**Section:** §3 Test Harness Contract / Log format
**Change:** added a note that the `tracing` self-observation stream (stderr / `logs/agent-latest.jsonl`; per-line base fields incl service-identity + `run_id`, obs-plan §3) is a SEPARATE artifact from the per-run emission journal (`runs/<run_id>.jsonl`, the SLO ground truth + Run-report envelope) — the two schemas must not be conflated.
**Why:** D-tests-obs-harness fired on the chunk's new flat `service.*` self-obs fields. Validated (main) that those belong to the self-obs stream, NOT the emission-journal envelope test-plan §3 owns — so the bound §3 ↔ obs-plan §3 envelope is unchanged; the amendment is a clarifying cross-reference, not a field addition to the envelope.

## 2026-06-15-design-token-typography-bundle — frontend (ui/) tests build-gated, unit deferred to Epoch 9
**Section:** §4 Unit Test Strategy (What unit tests cover)
**Change:** added a `conductor-tauri/ui` bullet — the React/Tailwind token bundle carries no Rust/nextest unit tests; it is build-gated (`tsc --noEmit` + `vite build` + `npm audit` + `vite preview` render smoke), and frontend coverage (webview E2E via tauri-driver) is deferred to Epoch 9.
**Why:** D-tests-coverage (warning) fired on the new frontend code paths having no unit tests; routine per playbook (a Foundation chunk defers a downstream-sequenced concern — §12 Decisions Log already records no JS/TS unit runner adopted, GUI convenience-only). No envelope/harness change; D-tests-framework + D-tests-obs-harness clear. No distillation cascade (tests-summary/testing.md describe the unchanged Rust test strategy).
